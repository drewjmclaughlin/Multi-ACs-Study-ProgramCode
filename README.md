# Multi-ACs-Study-ProgramCode
Python program code for "Coping with Adversity: Individual Differences in the Perception of Noisy and Accented Speech."

To use this program, create a folder ("mds") and add the above files/folders (after decompressing). The folder "sounds" should be put within the "resources" folder. Github was unable to upload these folders together due to size limitations. 

The python program is meant to be run out of Terminal by calling the folder "mds."
